# Music History 7

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires that you have completed the [Music History 6](../../3-modern-javascript-developer/exercises/MJ_BROWSERIFY_MUSIC_HISTORY_06.md) exercise.

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/musichistory
`git checkout -b version-7`
```

> :pencil2: For this exercise you will need to update your `.gitignore` file

Add the following line to .gitignore

```
.sass-cache
```

## Requirements

### Using SASS

All your current CSS should be converted into SASS, and you must use SASS from this point forward.

### Using Automation

As you are working, ensure that your Gulp/Grunt task is running at all times so that your JavaScript code is automatically checked as you're writing it, and your SASS is compiled into CSS.

> :pencil2: After you run your Gulp/Grunt task, if you add more JavaScript files, you need to restart grunt so that it recognizes the new file you added.

### Using Bootstrap

You need to have your application refactored to use the Bootstrap grid system for layout. From this point on, styling of your application is completely up to you, but you must be using Bootstrap grid system for layouts.

# Github Projects

## :pushpin: With each group project you work on your team will need to have a Github projects board.

### About project boards

Project boards help you organize and prioritize your workflow. These boards are made up of cards that are categorized in columns. Cards can be issues, pull requests and notes that can be moved between columns. Cards can contain information about who is assigned a particular piece of work, the status of that piece, and who opened it.

### Creating project boards

To create a project board you must have write access to the repository. Click the `Projects` header tab, then `Create a Project`. Once the project is created you will need three columns. They should be titled `Backlog`, `Doing` and `Complete`. You may also want to have a `Review` column to organize your pull requests, but it isn't a requirement.

# Music History 10

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires that you have completed the [Music History 9](../../4-rich-browser-applications/exercises/RBA_MUSIC_HISTORY_09.md) exercise.

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/musichistory
git checkout -b version-10
```

## Requirements

Refactor Music History, or choose to rebuild from scratch (whichever you deem most effecient), using Angular.

1. You will need two partials
    1. song-list.html
    1. song-details.html
1. You will need a controller for each partial
1. Use `ngRoute` to specify which URL route loads each partial
1. If you find that you are making similar requests to get your data in each of the controllers, make a factory for each controller to use.

### Song List View

Remove the filter form that you've used on previous versions, and just provide a text box above the song list that will use whatever the user types in to filter the list on song title, album or artist name.
